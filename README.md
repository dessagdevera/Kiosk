### A group project where I led the overall structure of the system. 

During my third year at college, I had the opportunity to lead a team that developed a self-service ordering system for a local cafe in our area. Our system was able to generate data on daily, weekly, and monthly sales, as well as order tracking. Furthermore, the system could print receipts after orders were placed. Our team successfully designed a user-friendly kiosk system that provided convenience for both customers and staff, while simultaneously improving the overall efficiency of the cafe's ordering process.
